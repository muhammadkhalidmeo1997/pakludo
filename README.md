**WORDLE:**

Wordle is a web-based word game created and developed by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle. 

Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of coloured tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. 

Wordle has a single daily solution, with all players attempting to guess the same word. During 2023, Wordle was played 4.8 billion times.

Wardle created the game to play with his partner, eventually making it public in October 2021. The mechanics are similar to the 1955 pen-and-paper game Jotto and the television game show franchise Lingo. 

The game gained popularity in December 2021 after Wardle added the ability for players to copy their daily results as emoji squares, which were widely shared on Twitter.Many clones and variations of the game were also created, as were versions in languages besides English. Wordle was purchased by The New York Times Company in January 2022 for an undisclosed seven-figure sum and moved to the games section of The New York Times in February.

**Gameplay:**

A four-row grid of white letters in coloured square tiles, with 5 letters in each row, reading ARISE, ROUTE, RULES, REBUS. 
The A, I, O, T, and L are in grey squares; the R, S, and E of ARISE, U and E of ROUTE, and U and E of RULES are in yellow squares, and the R of ROUTE, R and S of RULES, and all letters of REBUS are in green squares. Wordle #196 solved in 4 guesses.

Text saying "Wordle 196 4/6", followed by four lines of five emoji boxes each: white, yellow, white, yellow, yellow; green, white, yellow, white, yellow; green, yellow, white, yellow, green; green, green, green, green, green.
The emoji grid copied by sharing the result from the Wordle game. In text form:

Every day, a five-letter word is chosen which players aim to guess within six tries.After every guess, each letter is marked as either green, yellow or gray: green indicates that the letter is correct and in the correct position, yellow means it is in the answer but not in the right position, while gray indicates it is not in the answer at all.
Multiple instances of the same letter in a guess, such as the "o"s in "robot", will be colored green or yellow only if the letter also appears multiple times in the answer; otherwise, excess repeating letters will be colored gray.

The game has a "hard mode" option, which requires players to include letters marked as green and yellow in subsequent guesses.The daily word is the same for everyone.
The game also has a dark theme as well as a high-contrast theme for colorblind accessibility, which changes the color scheme from green and yellow to orange and blue.

Conceptually and stylistically, the game is similar to the 1955 pen-and-paper game Jotto and the game show franchise Lingo.The gameplay is also similar to the two-player board game Mastermind—which had a word-guessing variant Word Mastermind and the game Bulls and Cows, with the exception that Wordle confirms the specific letters that are correct.

Each daily game uses a word from a list of 2,309 words. The smaller word list was chosen by Wardle and his partner by filtering down lists she made by categorizing all the five-letter words into those she knew, those she did not know, and those she might have known.

Wordle uses American spelling, and players outside the US have complained that this spelling convention gives American players an unfair advantage (e.g., the use of "favor" rather than the non-US "favour").

According to data collected by The New York Times, the most common first guesses are "adieu", "audio", "stare", "raise", and "arise".However, it was found that starting words such as "adieu" and "audio" may put people at a disadvantage as it takes more attempts for people to solve than if they start with words such as "slate". Computer algorithms can solve the puzzle with 100% accuracy within 5 of the 6 allowed guesses.
